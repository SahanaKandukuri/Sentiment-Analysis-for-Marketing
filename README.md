# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Marketing
Sentiment analysis is a strategy that uses natural language processing to extract insights from raw  text and comments, for example, to understand the sentiment of a customer/user. In this project, we are trying to enable companies to understand the scope of a product ahead of its launch, also provide insights based on previous customer reviews so marketing teams can better  design their marketing campaigns.
